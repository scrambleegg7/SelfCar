    "My main pipeline of the project consisted of 5 steps as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grayscale\n",
    "This is a first step to convert colored image into Black and White image to suppress any impact of 3 layers of colored image. Not only shrinking the data size / amount to single dimention, but also    \n",

    "\n",
    "2. Gaussian Blur\n",
    "The second step is Gaussian Blur processing which remove high-frequency data (a.k.a noize) from images. It also gives completed image more smoother in data block.\n",
    "I have setup kernel parameter = 15 and then generated from gray scale images as below.\n",
    "\n",
