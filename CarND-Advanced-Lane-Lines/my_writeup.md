**Advanced Lane Finding Project**


It is 4th assigned project of UdaCity Nanodegree Self-Driving Car Course. It needs deep image processing to detect straight line
and curved line after image conversion to binary masked image.

The goals / steps of this project we have to address are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.

# Camera Calibration (Part1)

## 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

This part is described and program coded on **calibration.ipynb** jupyter notebook under root directory "CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines.


First of all, I started by preparing to build python class module ChessBoardClass, which encupsuled some of siginificant methods for setting full set of test images, and checking chessboard corners.
Following process are cordinatd through this class module method.

__*Initial Process of class module*__:
class module has initial parameters to set the default chess size. By visual confirmation, I have setup 9 for x-axis and 6 for y-axis for number of crosspoints of chessboards. Those parameters are used for checkChessBoard method.

1. **setImage method**: Image filenames are set and then open skimage imread function. Then I converted 3 channel colored image to gray image, which of the dimention is downgraded to 1. I have used standard cv2.cvtCOLOR function with parameter COLOR_RGB2GRAY.

2. **checkCessBoard** method:
After converting gray image from original colored image, all of incoming images are saved in the memory (gray_images list) of class module, then corner points are searched with cv2.findChessboard function by iterating gray_images list. If success to find the corners of target chessboard, obj points and corners list returned with the function are saved in objpoints and imgpoints list respectively. Finally cv2.drawChessboardCorners function draw the corner points on the original images. Please see the result image from drawChessBoaardCorners as following.
Also, the methods save unidentified chessboards, on which cv2 function can hardly detect the corners.   

3. **undistort** method:
I have applied cv2.calibrateCamera so that it simply outputs several siginificant parameters (mts / dist) from saved objpoints and imgpoints list, those 2 key ones are used for cv2.undistort function to generate undistortion image. After applying cv2.undistort against original image, I have saved ones and show the correct chessboards  on the attached source. They have rather straight lines than original ones on each top and bottom of images.   

4. **saveCalibParameters**
I have kept mtx and dist parameters from cv2.calibrateCamera function. Those 2 important parameters are passed to further undistortion function of reading other standard photo images.
Therefore, I have saved **mtx** and **dist** parameters on pickle file.
The filename __calibration.p__ has been saved under ./picked_data directory.  

### It is successful to find the corners of the chessboards and then draw the line and corner points.

# Pipeline Image process for binary masking (Part2)

 This is written on `pipelineTestImage.ipynb` juyter notebook for the demonstration how I build transfered (threshhold) images from original road images.

## 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

With using cv2.undistort function and saved parameters **mtx** and **dist**, I have successfully transformed the undistortion image from original road images. It is confirmed that images are adjusted based on the camera calibration parameters, in special distortion images (eg. slightly curved lines) are clearly purged from original ones. For example, the back of white car is truncated from the right side of image window.
I have demonstrated original and adjusted images side by side on jupyter notebook.


![alt text][normal_undistort]

## 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

### 2.1 Split Channel RGB colored image
At first step, I splitted out Red, Green, Blue channel from original one to find out which channel has strong features for the lane line. I have confirmed that Red and Green channel showed us good image contrasts to draw the line on separated Gray image. Blue was unfortunately poor result.

![alt text][rgb]


### 2.2 Extract Yellow & White & HLS Yellow to make mixed mask image

I have set several color parameters to extract yellow and white color from original images. (`threshColoredImageBin submodule of utils.py`)
Target colored lines are drawn accordingly on each binary image and then finally those are put together into one single binary image by switching on True condition of each filtering image.
Overall, we have found that HLS Yellow line is better displayed from the bottom of the image window, which of length is much longer than simple Yellow line binary extraction.  
Finally, I have combined all of three binary images so that I would show the effectiveness of consolidated binary image.
It is apparently 2 lane lines are drawn on the integrated binary image.   

```
    # rgb Yellow colored mask
    lower = np.array([255,180,0]).astype(np.uint8)
    upper = np.array([255,255,170]).astype(np.uint8)

    # rgb white colored mask
    lower = np.array([100,100,200]).astype(np.uint8)
    upper = np.array([255,255,255]).astype(np.uint8)

    # HLS yellow fitltering
    lower = np.array([20,120,80]).astype(np.uint8)
    upper = np.array([45,200,255]).astype(np.uint8)

```

### 2.3 Sobel X / Y Direction
At 2nd step, I have applied Sobel Gradient technique against original images (undistortion). Following tables indicates what kinds of parameters I have tested.

 | Parameter        | value   |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| direction     | x  & y      |
| thresh_min      | 20       |
| thresh_max     | 100    |
| kernel size     | 3, 5, 15       |

After obtaining result from sobel gradient techiques, image having kernel size = 15 has remarkable contrast that we could easily identify thick lane line on the binary transformed images.
I tried to show 2 different direction, X and Y from original images, but there are some noisy tones dislayed on the generated images of Sobel Y.

#### solbelX
![alt text][sobelx]
#### sobelY
![alt text][sobely]



### 2.4 Magnitude Sobel
Next I have applied Magnitude Sobel Technique, which has combination of Sobel X and Y direction Gradient image. Though we see kernel size = 15 is best performance to show the contrast, some lane lines are fully depicted on both test4 and test5 images. Because those 2 images have big color contrast on road surface, therefore it is hard to catch lane lines as continuous ones.

 | Parameter        | value   |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| direction     | x and y       |
| thresh_min      | 20       |
| thresh_max     | 150    |
| kernel size     | 3, 7, 15       |

![alt text][mag]


### 2.5 Direction of Gradient
Finally I have tested Direction of Gradient Technique as single testing module. Following are 2 main parameters I have setup for testing purposes to see effect of filtering with different parameters. The `thresh-2`, a.k.a (0.7,1.3) is same setting as Text book suggested to test image. Clearly, we found `thresh-2` parameter gave good contrast performance of filtering images, where we see lane lines are deciphered from snow-style background image.  


| Parameter        | value   |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| thresh-1       |    (0, np.pi / 2)  |
| thresh-2    | (0.7, 1.3)    |

![alt text][dir]


### 2.6 Combination of Sobel / Magnitude / Direction of Gradient  
Then I have integrated above 4 techniques to make blend image showing lane line with the binary image as following code. I have picked up best parameters for respective gradient techniques. I obtained good result overall from mixed images,
however some of images like **test4** and **test5** has lost contrast on upper half of each window, in a result to have incapability of drawing full length of lane lines.

```
def applyCombinedGradient(x):

    sobel_imagex = abs_sobel_thresh(x, orient='x', thresh_min=20, thresh_max=120, kernel_size=15)
    sobel_imagey = abs_sobel_thresh(x, orient='y', thresh_min=20, thresh_max=120, kernel_size=15)

    mag_binary = mag_thresh(x, sobel_kernel=15, mag_thresh=(80, 200))
    dir_binary = dir_threshold(x, sobel_kernel=15, thresh=(np.pi/4, np.pi/2) )

    mybinary = np.zeros_like(dir_binary)
    mybinary[ ((sobel_imagex == 1) & (sobel_imagey == 1)) | ( (mag_binary == 1) & (dir_binary == 1)      )      ] = 1
    #mybinary[(sobel_imagex == 1) | ((sobel_imagey == 1) & (mag_binary == 1) & (dir_binary == 1))] = 1
    return mybinary
```
![alt text][sobelcombine]


Thus we need to grab more contrast for Yellow and White line on the road, then I have decided to apply HSL binary image filtering.
One is to use full channels of HLS extracting Yellow and White line, another is to focus on just S channel having threshold parameters for Yellow and White line.

### 2.7 HLS Image

Looking at the below sample to devide 3 channels into H L S from cv2.cvColor function, L and S channel has robust outcome to show the yellow and white line. So we we will take a further look at both channel how we can highlight yellow and white lanes from road image.

I briefly go through the following refence web page to take deep insight of color channels like HLS and RGB etc..
https://www.learnopencv.com/color-spaces-in-opencv-cpp-python/

![alt text][hls]

Using following S channel threshhold setting, we can see yellow lines are fairly robust to draw it as the extended lines from bottom to top of each images. On the `test4` and `test5` road images, it is confirmed that left lines can be clearly viewed.  

```
    # input is RGB (skimage.io.imread)

    hls = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2HLS)
    S = hls[:,:,2]  # 2 <-- S channel     

    binary = np.zeros_like(S)
    binary[(S > thresh[0]) & (S <= thresh[1])] = 1

```
![alt text][s_thresh]


### 2.8 Integration with HLS Color and Binary threshhold

Here I have combined HLS color image and Binary threshhold to build up more robust images of lane lines. There are 3 scenario I have tried

| No        | Color    |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Scenario 1 | HLS Color masking + Sobel Combinnation (build on section 2.6) |
| Scenario 2    | S channel threshhold + Sobel Combinnation (build on section 2.6)    |
| Scenario 3   | S channel threshhold +  L channel Sobel Combinnation    |

#### Colored Image
This is stacked image to save S channel (or HLS masking) and Sobel combination on Green and Blue channel respectively, thus we instantly understand what layer has what kinds of impacts on transferred image.

![alt text][hls_color]

#### Integrated Binary Image
Finally, I have integrated S channel threshhold and Sobel threshhold binary into one image for the above mentioned scenarios.

![alt text][hls_binary]



## 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

### 3.1 Bird View Image

The code for my perspective transform is written on `warp_gen` module. After grabing gray conversion image shape, original trapezoid shape defined as **src** array has been transfered to squre style polygon, which region is defined as **dst**.  **src** and **dst** are hardcoded parameters on program code.

Then, Opencv perspectivetransform and warpPerspective are used to make bird view images.  


```python
src = np.float32([[270,674],
                 [579,460],
                 [702,460],
                 [1060,674]])
dst = np.float32([[270,674],
                 [270,0],
                 [1035,0],
                 [1035,674]])
```

The source codes related to perspective transformation of undistorted original images are splitted into 3 parts, which are **M_gen**, **warp_gen**, and **undistort_corners** as follows.

```
def M_gen(src,dst):

    # Given src and dst points, calculate the perspective transform matrix
    # source is 4 points trapezoid
    # destination is 4 points rectangle
    M = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(src, dst)
    Minv = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(dst, src)
    return M, Minv

def warp_gen(img,M):
    # check out the image shape
    img_size = ( img.shape[1], img.shape[0] )
    warped = cv2.warpPerspective(img, M, img_size)
    # Return the resulting image and matrix
    return warped

def undistort_corners(img, mtx, dist):

    # images should be undistortion based on camera calibration.
    # incoming image is RGB format --> skimage.io.imread
    undist = cv2.undistort(img, mtx, dist, None, mtx)
    return undist
```

For the visual verification to investigate whether area are correctly cropped and transformed to bird view images, I have generated comaprison image matrix for normal and warped images as follows;
Straight lane lines and curved lane lines are confirmed to draw the paralell ones on respective new transformed images.

![alt text][warp]

### 3.2 Binary Warped Image

Then I have converted warp images to Binary Images so that both yellow and white lines are highlighted as white lines on binary images.
There are some noisy scattered points displayed on test5.

![alt text][warp_binary]

## 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

### 4.1 Histogram approach
First, I have applied histogram approach which detects center, left and right lane points from warped images, then counts how many pixcel are plotted as lane every sliding squared box from bottom to top of each images. Initial sliding window size is set to 9, therefore 9 small windows are build up from bottom to top so that function pick up pixcel points.
If pixcel point recognized as lane line is deteced on binary image, those scatter plot points are saved **(x,y)** and then build up array to store all points on x and y axis.
Once those slinding window searching technique is finalized on each image, all pixcel data are put into polynormal function of numpy. then we can get coefficient parameter a, b and c from standard mathematical formula.   

$$x = ay^2 + by + c$$

![alt text][histogram]

The below image tables show fitting curves on sample test images based on searched lane line plotting data. There are several curve lanes depicted on the bird view images.

![alt text][initFit]


## 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I have utilized following math formula to calculate each lane line curvature on the road. A and B is a cofficient parameters generated from polyfit function.
Also, y and x are converted in real meaurement of the lane line on the road. Those values are according to US road regulation.
Thus, x and y are calculated as meters per pixel, then the radius of curvature is displayed as meter.

```
def curvature(ploty, left_fitx, right_fitx):

    #
    # This logic can be used for sanitary check polyfit calculation.
    #
    y_eval = np.max(ploty)
    # Define conversions in x and y from pixels space to meters
    ym_per_pix = 30/720.0 # meters per pixel in y dimension
    xm_per_pix = 3.7/700.0 # meters per pixel in x dimension

    lefty = ploty*ym_per_pix
    leftx = left_fitx*xm_per_pix
    righty = ploty*ym_per_pix
    rightx = right_fitx*xm_per_pix

    left_fit_cr, right_fit_cr = fitting(lefty,leftx,righty,rightx)
    #left_fit_cr = np.polyfit(ploty*ym_per_pix, left_fitx*xm_per_pix, 2)
    #right_fit_cr = np.polyfit(ploty*ym_per_pix, right_fitx*xm_per_pix, 2)    
    # Calculate the new radii of curvature
    a, b, c = left_fit_cr
    left_curverad = ((1 + (2*a*y_eval*ym_per_pix + b)**2)**1.5) / np.absolute(2*a)

    a, b, c = right_fit_cr
    right_curverad = ((1 + (2*a*y_eval*ym_per_pix + b)**2)**1.5) / np.absolute(2*a)
    return left_curverad, right_curverad
    # Now our radius of curvature is in meters
```

* A and B is fitting parameters.
 $$R_{curve} = \frac{ (1 + (2Ay + B)^2) ^\frac{3}{2}  }{ |2A| } $$



#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

The below are result imagesm which plotted bach down the road image. Also, I have described left and right radius of curvature on the integrated image.

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

In the end to finalize 4th CarND Advanced Lane, I have successfully generated video (normal version) which can higlight the green tapezoid zone indentical to real road lane after finding target zone.
Apart from jupyter notebook, I have build another python program **LangeDetector class module** to generate stream lined video file.
then main program **Video.py** call LaneDetector class module.

```
def main():

    paramCls = ParametersClass()
    params = paramCls.initialize()


    print("-"*30)
    print("* incoming video file name *",params.infile)
    print("-"*30)

    input_video = params.infile

    output_video = os.path.join("output_images",input_video )

    lane_detector = LaneDetector()

    clip1 = VideoFileClip(input_video)
    video_clip = clip1.fl_image(lane_detector.image_pipeline)
    video_clip.write_videofile(output_video, audio=False)
```

Here's a [link to my video result](./output_images/project_video.mp4)

# Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

## 1. Building Binary Image.
As text book suggested, there are no gound true answer to make final binary image (eg. masking yellow line and white line from readl road image), THus we need to go through numerious image scneaios starting from RGB chanel analysis to making the combined image of colored and binary threshhold. Even after number of trials to tweak parameters for threshold and split each channel consisting of undistorted images, we need to come back to search another best parameters if we fail to get lane line, especially curved lane. It was time consuming process for me to get final parameters.

## 2. Finding lane.
As described in the section **Pipeline Video** section, I have succesfully get it done to make a visualized video file integrating real road image and selected lane area highlighted with green color. Lane finding algorythm works well for the constant image, which clearly has yellow and white line without any interrupted obstruction, however once road condition is changed, it lose to calculate right lane line points due to contrast of lane line is shrinked. For example, road image around 41seconds from starting points of video file, lane lines are shaded with the shadow of the trees. Then curvature values of left and right side are dramatically decreased close to 100m.
We need to make another approach for making binary threshold image file for any scenarios of the road condition, as a result to make more generalized model making.

## 3. To overcome Challange Video
For challenge video, I have provided another program to have more credibilities indentifying lane line on the shade of the road image. Prrogran code is `LaneDetector-Challenge2.py`. The program I build for normal video, that only supports stable daylight contrast, thus it is easy to catch the lane line with binary image like sobel and colored threshold technique. The enhanced program separate yellow and white line from real image with color threshold technique and make warped binary image, so that program detect most condensed plot area representing the lane lines, and then save last 30 frames curve for making extended curved lane lines assuming the curvature of the lane should not have big delta. 

Here's a [link to my video result](./output_images/challenge_video.mp4)
